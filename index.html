    <h1 style="font-size:45px">What is Music?</h1><hr>
    <div class="music-image">

    </div>
    <p>Music is pure magic. It is a wonderful gift to humanity. Music moves us, and soothes us. It stimulates. It makes us want to dance or sing.
     It makes us feel happy or sad, inspired or uplifted. It affects our mood in all kinds of infinite ways.
     It can be exquisitely subtle or wildly raucous: from a lullaby, to a war cry for revolution.
   </p>
   <p>Music is different things to different people: to Ian Skelly, author of the article ‘Beauty Speaks’, above all things music has a transcendental significance that is captured in the beautiful patterns of Nature and architecture – a kind of ‘frozen music’; to Mark Kidel, author of ‘Conversations and Crossroads’, music can bridge cultures in a universal ‘conversation’ that is beyond intellect or reason, but which is heartfelt; to Brian Eno, music brings the joy of unexpected and beautiful sound; and to singer/songwriters like myself and Howard Milner, music – and singing in particular – takes us to a world apart: a world beyond self and ego; a place of emotion that touches the soul.</p>

    <h1 style="font-size:45px">History of Music</h1><hr>

    </div>
    <p>The origin of music itself is very difficult to determine because in all probability, it is likely to have begun with singing and clapping or beating the hands on different surfaces, for which there is no of course no archaeological record.

However, between at least 60,000 and 30,000 years ago, ancient humans experienced a type of ‘cultural explosion’ – they started creating art in the form of paintings on cave walls, jewellery and ornaments, and to bury their dead ceremonially. If we assume that these new forms of behaviour reflect the emergence of intentionality, then music as we know it must also have emerged at least during this period.

Evolutionary scientists believe that a musical culture would have helped prehistoric human species to survive because the music coordinates emotions, helps important messages to be communicated, motivates people to identify with a group, and motivates individuals to support other group members.

<h3>Oldest musical instrument</h3><hr>
  <div class="oldins-image">
    <img src="image\oldins.jpg" alt="error!!" style="height:300px">
    <figcaption>fig.1.One of the flutes has been <br> fashioned from mammoth ivory</figcaption>
  </div>
<p>
The oldest musical instrument ever discovered is believed to be the Divje Babe flute, discovered in a cave in Slovenia in 1995, though this has been disputed.  The item is a fragment of the femur of a cave bear, which has been dated at 60,000-43,000 years old, which had been pierced with spaced holes.  Scientists who could not accept the possibility that Neanderthals were playing music rejected the claim and said that the perfectly spaced and neatly carved holes are in fact the result of the bone fragment having been chewed by an animal. However, a general consensus that the Divje Babe flute is actually a musical instrument has been growing as the view of the Neanderthals from subhuman brutes to more sophisticated humans is changing.
</p>
<p>In 2008, another discovery was made – a bone flute in the Hohle Fels cave near Ulm in Germany dating back 43,000 years.  The five-holed flute has a V-shaped mouthpiece and is made from a vulture wing bone.  It was one of several similar instruments found in the area, with others dating back to 35,000 years ago and made from mammoth ivory.  The mammoth-ivory flutes would have been especially challenging to make. Using only stone tools, the flute maker would have had to split a section of curved ivory along its natural grain. The two halves would then have been hollowed out, carved, and fitted together with an airtight seal.

The cave in southern Germany contains early evidence for the occupation of Europe by Homo sapiens and on announcing the discovery, scientists suggested that the "finds demonstrate the presence of a well-established musical tradition at the time when modern humans colonized Europe".  They suggested that music may have helped to maintain bonds between larger groups of humans, and that this may have helped the species to expand both in numbers and in geographical range.

Those who have rejected the finding of the Divje Babe flute have claimed that music played a role in the maintenance of larger social networks which may have given modern humans the edge over the Neanderthals. However, looking at the images of the Dibje Babe flute, which dates back to the time of the Neanderthals, it seems quite ridiculous to assume that it was made by the tooth holes of carnivores.

    <h1 style="font-size:45px">Impact</h1><hr>
    <p>Researchers are discovering how music affects the brain, helping us to make sense of its real emotional and social power</p>
    <p>Music impacts us in ways that other sounds don’t, and for years now, scientists have been wondering why.
       Now they are finally beginning to find some answers. Using fMRI technology,
       they’re discovering why music can inspire such strong feelings and bind us so tightly to other people.
     </p>
     <p>“Music affects deep emotional centers in the brain, “ says Valorie Salimpoor, a neuroscientist at McGill University
        who studies the brain on music.“A single sound tone is not really pleasurable in itself;
       but if these sounds are organized over time in some sort of arrangement, it’s amazingly powerful.”
     </p><br>

      <h3> How music makes the brain happy?</h3><hr>
      <p>
       How powerful? In one of her studies, she and her colleagues hooked up participants to an fMRI machine and
       recorded their brain activity as they listened to a favorite piece of music. During peak emotional moments in the songs identified
       by the listeners, dopamine was released in the nucleus accumbens, a structure deep within the older part of our human brain.
     </p>
     <div class="impact-image">
       <img src="image\listen.jpg" alt="error!!" style="height:200px">
     </div>
     <p>There’s another part of the brain that seeps dopamine, specifically just before those peak emotional moments in a song:
        the caudate nucleus, which is involved in the anticipation of pleasure.
         Presumably, the anticipatory pleasure comes from familiarity with the song—you have a memory of the song you enjoyed
         in the past embedded in your brain, and you anticipate the high points that are coming. This pairing of anticipation and
         pleasure is a potent combination, one that suggests we are biologically-driven to listen to music we like.
